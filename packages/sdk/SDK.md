# Riff SDK 0.3.0 — handler contract

Compatibility: 0.2.0 artifacts must be regenerated. 0.3.0 adds live execution, the
`heart` asset, case-insensitive commands and declarative scenario tests.

## Handler

Source is ONE JavaScript function expression `(event, riff) => void | Promise<void>`.
No imports, require, eval, Function, Date, Math.random, timers, network, filesystem or
globalThis. Loops need explicit bounds. Every invocation starts from fresh globals and
closures; nothing survives to the next event. The host has already checked the
command, the audience and every allowance before the handler runs, so a handler only
decides which effects to show.

`event`: { id, channelId, viewerId, roles, text, at }. roles ⊆ viewer, subscriber,
moderator, broadcaster; every chatter has `viewer`. text ≤ 500 chars.

`riff.overlay.emit(effect): Promise<void>` (capability `overlay`) stages one
projectile: { kind: 'projectile', asset: 'tomato' | 'star' | 'heart', x } with x a
finite number in [0, 1] (horizontal launch position). Example:
`await riff.overlay.emit({ kind: 'projectile', asset: 'tomato', x: riff.util.random() })`

`riff.util.now()` returns event.at. `riff.util.random()` is a seeded deterministic
number in [0, 1).

Any thrown error, invalid effect, undeclared capability, too many effects, more than
25 bridge calls, 50 ms CPU, 2 s wall time or 64 MB memory quarantines the version and
discards every effect from that event.

## Permission manifest

{
  sdkVersion: '0.3.0',
  capabilities: ['overlay'],              // exactly the capabilities the source uses
  trigger: {
    command: '!tomato',                   // lowercase, ^![a-z0-9_-]{1,32}$
    audience: ['viewer'],                 // any listed role may trigger; viewer = everyone
    maxPerViewer: 3,                      // 1..100 accepted actions per viewer ...
    windowMs: 60000                       // ... in any rolling window, 1000..3600000 ms
  },
  limits: { effectsPerEvent: 1, effectsPerMinute: 60 }   // 1..10 and 1..120
}

## Host admission order (scenario expectations must follow it exactly)

For each event the host returns exactly one decision code:
1. DUPLICATE — the same event id was already seen in this scenario (0 effects).
2. UNRELATED — text.trim().toLowerCase() !== command (0 effects). "!tomatoes" and
   "hi !tomato" are UNRELATED; "  !TOMATO " matches.
3. AUDIENCE — none of the event roles is listed in trigger.audience (0 effects).
4. VIEWER_LIMIT — this viewer already has maxPerViewer accepted actions with
   time > at - windowMs (0 effects). Only ACCEPTED events that emitted at least one
   effect count. An action at t=0 with windowMs=60000 stops counting at t=60000.
5. CHANNEL_LIMIT — the effects emitted in the last 60 s reached effectsPerMinute.
6. ACCEPTED — the handler ran; the step's effects count is the number it emitted.

## Scenario tests (data, not code)

Tests are an array of 3..12 scenarios. Each scenario runs in a fresh engine:
{ name, kind: 'happy'|'limit'|'role'|'negative'|'duplicate'|'window', steps: [
  { id, viewer, roles, text, at, expect, effects } ] }
- id: unique per message unless deliberately repeated to model a duplicate delivery.
- viewer: lowercase synthetic name like "alice". at: ms since scenario start, never
  decreasing. expect: a decision code above. effects: exact number expected.
Required coverage: at least one happy path, one limit/role/window edge, and one
negative (unrelated chat does nothing).
